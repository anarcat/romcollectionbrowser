Navigation should be self explanating. Move around with the arrow keys and see what happens. There is an extra panel with filter controls at the top and a button panel at the bottom of the page. They will show up if they receive focus and hide if they lose it. In horizontal game lists you can go to the filter panel with the UP key and to the button panel with the DOWN key. In vertical lists the LEFT key will take you to the filter controls and the RIGHT key to the buttons.

If the filter controls own the focus you can set up all filters as you like and apply filter settings with "ENTER" (or SELECT-Button on the remote). Once you applied the filters or if you did not change any filters you can jump to the game list with "ENTER" again.

In game list you can launch games with "ENTER" or go to the details page with "I" (or INFO-Button on the remote). Since Eden you can start fullscreen video (if available) with "PLAY".

Pressing "C" or (MENU-button on the remote) will launch the context menu.

To exit the script or to leave the details page just press "ESC" (or BACK-Button on a remote).
