# Image placing #
With the image placing options you can select which image types are shown in which image controls. Note that not all RCB skins fully support image placing. Atm only the default Confluence skin has full image placing support.

You can define your own image placing options or edit the existing ones if they don't fit your needs. Check [this page](DynamicImagePlacing.md) for more information.

By default there will be 6 different image placing options:
