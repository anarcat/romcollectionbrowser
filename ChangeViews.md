All available skins for RCB support different views of your Rom Collection. Like all other lists in XBMC you can switch between Thumb views, Info views and many others. In RCBs default skin the "Change View" button is placed on the bottom panel. You can access it from horizontal game lists with the DOWN button, from vertical game lists with the RIGHT button.

In the screenshot below you can see the Confluence "Info" view with highlighted bottom panel.
