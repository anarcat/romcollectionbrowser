# Game filter #
You can filter your games by Console, Genre, Year, Publisher and first character. Additionally there is a search function and a favorite function. The filter controls are placed on the top panel that is hidden by default. You can access the panel from horizontal game lists with the UP button, from vertical game lists with the LEFT button. You can jump to the game list again by pressing "Enter" or "OK" on the remote on one of the filter controls.

Filter controls are updated from left to right: If you select a Console, all other controls (Genre, Year, Publisher) will only show entries that are available for this console. If you select a Genre all controls right to the Genre filter (Year and Publisher) will only show entries that are available for the selected Console and Genre. And so on.

In the screenshot below you can see the Confluence "Info" view with highlighted top panel.

# Favorite function #
With the "Favorites" button selected RCB will only display games that you have marked as favorite before (you can mark games as favorite via [context menu](ContextMenu.md)). By default RCB will also show a little star for favorite games. You can disable this in [Addon settings](AddonSettingsBrowseGames.md).

In the screenshot below you can see the Confluence "Info2" view with a favorites selection.

# Search function #
Selecting the "Search" button will launch the XBMC keyboard to enter a search term. RCB will display all games with this search term somewhere in its name (does not have to be at the beginning of the game name). To cancel a search just select the "Search" button again and submit it without entering a search term.

In the screenshot below you can see the Confluence "Info2" view with a search for "Super".
